Hi All,

The project is completely automated now for UIM scan .
Git hub URL: https://github.com/rajupathak/ScanAutomationUIPath

Follow the below steps to execute the project :

Step 1: Create the following folder structure in the 'D' drive. If you choose a different location, make sure to update the code accordingly. Maintain the spelling and structure as specified:

D:\UIPathRObot\UIMComponentScan.


Step 2: Navigate under UIMComponentScan folder open git bash and clone this run this command -->> git clone https://github.com/rajupathak/ScanAutomationUIPath.git


Step 3: Clone UIM source code project under this folder -> D:/UIMScanAutomation    - (git clone https://git.cwp.pnp-hcl.com/hcl-sametime/uime4-rtc-development.git) 
             

For me its under > D:/UIMScanAutomation/uime4-rtc-development  (try to clone UIM project also in same way, if not wherever your UIM project is please provide that path but u need to update that location in shell script which under this > D:\UIPathRObot\UIMComponentScan)

 


Step 4: Open UIpath studio (Assuming already downloaded from this location https://cloud.uipath.com/desktackmciy/portal_/home


Step5 . Once studio is opened click on open a project from local option

 

Step6: select project from folder where you have cloned i.e under d drive(D:\UIPathRObot\UIMComponentScan)
 

Step 7   Once Project is imported click on debug or run > 
 

Step8:It will ask for UIM project path where UIM (component.xml files are present) for me this > D:\UIMScanAutomation\uime4-rtc-development
 

Final Step : One popup will come to press ok and then automation will start.
 

Note : Please open app scan source first before running else it will take time to open

 

Regards
Rajesh
